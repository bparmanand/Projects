# Projects
<p>Here is a compilation of my work learned and conducted in Business Analytics / Data Science. 
<br>The majority of my coding work has been conducted in R using Rstudio predominantly but also base R and Jupyter Notebooks.
<br>I have also used Python, including the pandas packages and SQLite, and some julia lang which you can see in the Techniques folder.
<br>My research and analytics included predominantly regression models, but also well versed in decision trees, xgboost, random forest. My coursework also included cluster analysis, neural networks, and text mining which is shown through various projects.
